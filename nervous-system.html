											<h3>What is the nervous system?</h3>
											<p>
												The nervous system is the part of the body that controls voluntarily had involuntarily actions. It consists of two parts, the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The CNS contains the brain and spinal cord while the PNS contains motor neurons; which control voluntary actions. It also contains the autonomic nervous system. The nervous system contains a special type of cell, neurons; nerve cells. These neurons send signals rapidly to other cells, and send actions which allow your body to perform voluntary and involuntary actions.

											<h3>What's in the nervous system?</h3>
											<p>
												The nervous system is composed of many different parts, but the three basic ones are as follows: the brain, the spinal cord and the neurons. Neurons are what coordinate your body, sending signals from one place to another, almost messengers. They travel at extremely fast speeds; relaying messages in a matter of miliseconds. The spinal cord is what holds your body up. It is composed of many different vertebrae. If one of these breaks, your body collapses and you become paralysed. The brain is the most important part of the body, next to the heart. It is the control center of your brain, and even if it malfunctions for a minute, you could die. When you have an intracerebral hemmorhage, brain cells are effected, and damaged is caused to the brain. This can lead to other significant problems.  
											</p>
											<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
											<p>
												Without your nervous system and the parts in it, you wouldn't be able to live. The brain would not function, and so your body is like a cell without a nucleus. You would be slouched, and unable to move a muscle. Therefore, your nervous system is as important as your heart.
